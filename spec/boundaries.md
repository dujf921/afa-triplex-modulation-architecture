# AFA-TMA — Model Boundaries & Usage Constraints

This document defines the **non-negotiable boundaries** of the
AFA Triplex Modulation Architecture (AFA-TMA).

Its purpose is to prevent category errors, misuse, and improper extensions of the model.

---

## 1. Scope of Valid Application

AFA-TMA is a **structural causal architecture**.

It is valid only for analyzing systems at the level of:

- behavior formation
- decision simulation
- relational dynamics
- execution stability

The model operates exclusively on:
- functional networks (DMN / FP / ECN)
- hormonal modulation axes (dopamine / cortisol / oxytocin)

---

## 2. Explicit Non-Applications

AFA-TMA MUST NOT be used for:

- psychiatric diagnosis
- medical decision-making
- pharmacological evaluation
- therapy protocol design
- emotional categorization or regulation
- personality typing or trait attribution

Any attempt to apply AFA-TMA to these domains constitutes **category misuse**.

---

## 3. Hormones Are Not Emotions

Within AFA-TMA:

- dopamine is NOT motivation
- cortisol is NOT anxiety
- oxytocin is NOT love, bonding, or attachment

Hormones are defined strictly as **network modulation variables**.

Mapping hormones to subjective emotional labels violates the model’s causal structure.

---

## 4. Psychological Terminology Exclusion

AFA-TMA intentionally excludes:

- emotional descriptors
- introspective states
- phenomenological language
- narrative self-reports as causal variables

Such elements may appear as **outputs or observations**, but never as explanatory inputs.

---

## 5. Structural Entry Constraint

All valid explanations using AFA-TMA must begin from exactly one of the following entry points:

1. DMN template weighting change
2. FP simulation capacity change
3. ECN execution continuity change

Any explanation that bypasses these entry points is invalid within AFA-TMA.

---

## 6. No Individual Blame Interpretation

AFA-TMA does not attribute outcomes to:

- personal weakness
- character flaws
- moral failure
- lack of willpower

Observed failures are interpreted exclusively as **structural misalignments or modulation imbalances**.

---

## 7. No Prescriptive or Therapeutic Claims

AFA-TMA does not prescribe:

- treatment plans
- behavioral therapy steps
- emotional coping techniques

Any prescriptive use must be explicitly derived as a **separate applied framework**, not as part of the core model.

---

## 8. Extension Rule

Any extension of AFA-TMA must:

- preserve the triplex network separation
- preserve the hormone-to-network primary mapping
- avoid introducing new causal primitives without explicit justification

Violations constitute a **fork**, not an extension.
