# AFA-TMA — Formal Definitions
## Triplex Networks & Hormonal Modulation Axes

This document defines the **minimal, non-overlapping functional definitions** of the
AFA Triplex Modulation Architecture (AFA-TMA).

All definitions are **structural and causal**.
Psychological, emotional, or phenomenological terms are intentionally excluded.

---

## 1. Core Principle

AFA-TMA models human behavior as a **causally closed system** composed of:

- Three functional networks (DMN / FP / ECN)
- Three primary hormonal modulation axes (dopamine / cortisol / oxytocin)

Networks define **what can operate**.  
Hormones define **how strongly each operation is modulated**.

Hormones are **not emotions**.  
They are **computational modulation variables**.

## 2. Triplex Networks — Minimal Definitions

### 2.1 DMN — Template System (Default Mode Network)

**Functional Role**  
DMN functions as a **template repository**.

It provides:
- narrative templates  
- semantic templates  
- situational templates  

These templates represent *pre-existing interpretive structures* derived from
experience and memory.

**Capabilities**
- Provides templates only

**Explicit Limitations**
- Does NOT generate structured solutions  
- Does NOT perform causal simulation  
- Does NOT execute actions  

**Primary Modulation Axis**
- Cortisol

Cortisol increases the dominance of **threat-oriented templates** within DMN.

---

### 2.2 FP — Structured Simulation System (Frontoparietal Network)

**Functional Role**  
FP functions as a **structured causal simulation system**.

It integrates:
- templates provided by DMN  
- execution feedback provided by ECN  

FP produces:
- causal paths  
- candidate solutions  
- decision structures  

**Capabilities**
- Generates solutions
- Evaluates structural coherence
- Maintains simulation depth

**Explicit Limitations**
- Does NOT provide narrative templates  
- Does NOT execute actions  

**Primary Modulation Axis**
- Dopamine

Dopamine modulates:
- simulation energy
- solution generation capacity
- abstraction stability

---

### 2.3 ECN — Execution Chain System (Executive Control Network)

**Functional Role**  
ECN functions as an **execution chain**.

It converts FP-generated solutions into:
- ordered action sequences
- sustained task execution

**Capabilities**
- Executes actions
- Maintains execution continuity
- Suppresses interference

**Explicit Limitations**
- Does NOT generate solutions  
- Does NOT generate templates  

**Primary Modulation Axis**
- Oxytocin

Oxytocin modulates:
- execution continuity
- task persistence
- resistance to interruption

---

## 3. Hormonal Modulation Axes — Formal Definition

In AFA-TMA, hormones are defined as **primary modulation axes** acting on specific
networks.

They do not encode subjective experience.

---

### 3.1 Dopamine — FP Modulation Axis

**Primary Target**
- FP (Structured Simulation)

**Modulatory Effects**
- Increases solution generation energy
- Stabilizes abstract simulation
- Enables re-initiation of stalled simulation

**Secondary Effects**
- Weak facilitation of ECN initiation
- Minimal direct influence on DMN

---

### 3.2 Cortisol — DMN Modulation Axis

**Primary Target**
- DMN (Template System)

**Modulatory Effects**
- Increases threat-template weighting
- Prioritizes fixed, defensive narratives
- Suppresses FP simulation capacity
- Suppresses ECN execution continuity

Cortisol dominance results in **template occupation** of the system.

---

### 3.3 Oxytocin — ECN Modulation Axis

**Primary Target**
- ECN (Execution Chain)

**Modulatory Effects**
- Stabilizes execution chains
- Enhances task persistence
- Reduces execution dropout

**Secondary Effects**
- Indirectly weakens DMN threat dominance
- Provides a stable background for FP simulation execution

---

## 4. Network–Hormone Mapping (Canonical)

| Hormone    | Primary Network | Primary Function Modulated            |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Dopamine   | FP              | Simulation energy & solution capacity |
| Cortisol   | DMN             | Threat-template dominance              |
| Oxytocin   | ECN             | Execution continuity                   |

This mapping is **non-substitutable**.

Any model that treats these hormones as emotional labels
does NOT belong to AFA-TMA.

---

## 5. Structural Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

1. Templates can only originate from DMN  
2. Solutions can only originate from FP  
3. Actions can only originate from ECN  
4. Hormones modulate networks; networks do not generate hormones  
5. Any causal explanation must enter through:
   - DMN template weighting
   - FP simulation energy
   - ECN execution stability

Any explanation that violates these constraints is outside AFA-TMA.

---

## 6. Definition Scope

These definitions apply to:
- behavior formation
- decision processes
- relational dynamics
- execution stability

They do NOT apply to:
- emotional categorization
- personality typing
- psychiatric diagnosis
- therapeutic intervention protocols

End of definitions.
