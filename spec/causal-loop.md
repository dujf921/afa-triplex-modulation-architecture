# AFA-TMA — Minimal Causal Closed Loop (Hormone-Embedded)
## 7-Step Kernel for Triplex Networks × Modulation Axes

This document defines the **minimal reusable causal kernel** of the
AFA Triplex Modulation Architecture (AFA-TMA).

AFA-TMA requires that any explanation must enter through one of three entry variables:
- DMN template weighting (primarily modulated by cortisol)
- FP simulation energy (primarily modulated by dopamine)
- ECN execution stability (primarily modulated by oxytocin)

All steps below are structural. Hormones are modulation variables, not emotions.

## 1. Canonical Variables (Minimal Set)

### Network State Variables
- **DMN.TemplateWeight**: the current dominance distribution of templates in DMN
- **FP.SimulationCapacity**: available structured simulation space and coherence
- **ECN.ExecutionContinuity**: stability of action sequences over time

### Modulation Axes (Primary)
- **Cortisol (C)**: increases threat-template dominance in DMN; suppresses FP/ECN
- **Dopamine (D)**: increases FP simulation energy; supports solution generation
- **Oxytocin (O)**: increases ECN execution continuity; indirectly reduces threat dominance

## 2. The 7-Step Negative Closed Loop (Hormone-Embedded)

### Step 1 — Cortisol↑ → DMN threat-template dominance↑
When cortisol increases, **DMN.TemplateWeight** shifts toward threat-oriented templates.

**Output:** DMN templates become threat-prioritized.

---

### Step 2 — DMN dominance↑ → FP simulation space↓
As threat templates dominate DMN, FP receives a constrained template set, reducing
**FP.SimulationCapacity**.

**Output:** fewer candidate solutions, shallower simulation, reduced coherence.

---

### Step 3 — FP simulation↓ → ECN execution breaks (severity shaped by oxytocin)
With insufficient FP output, ECN receives fewer viable solutions and weaker sequencing cues.
**ECN.ExecutionContinuity** becomes unstable.

- If oxytocin is low: execution breaks are frequent and persistent.
- If oxytocin is sufficient: execution can remain partially stable despite reduced FP output.

**Output:** action sequences fragment or fail to persist.

---

### Step 4 — Execution breaks → real-world feedback missing
When ECN execution fragments, the system fails to obtain stable outcome feedback.

**Output:** the environment stops providing high-quality update signals.

---

### Step 5 — Feedback missing → DMN templates fail to update away from threat bias
Without execution feedback, DMN does not receive corrective signals that would reduce
threat-template dominance. Cortisol-maintained weighting remains unchallenged.

**Output:** DMN.TemplateWeight remains threat-biased.

---

### Step 6 — Dopamine不足 → FP cannot reboot solution generation
Even if new templates are potentially available, insufficient dopamine reduces FP’s ability
to restart and sustain simulation, preventing recovery of **FP.SimulationCapacity**.

**Output:** FP remains stalled; solution generation does not restart.

---

### Step 7 — Closed-loop lock-in
The system locks into a self-reinforcing loop:

**Threat templates (DMN) → Simulation collapse (FP) → Execution break (ECN) → Feedback loss → Template reinforcement (DMN)**

This is the minimal negative attractor of AFA-TMA.

---

## 3. Symmetric Positive Recovery Loop (Minimal)

AFA-TMA defines a recovery path as a structural inversion:

1. **Dopamine↑ → FP simulation energy↑**
2. **FP outputs a structurally coherent solution**
3. **Oxytocin-supported ECN sustains execution**
4. **Stable execution produces real-world feedback**
5. **Feedback updates DMN templates away from threat bias**
6. **Cortisol decreases as threat dominance weakens**
7. **Triplex coupling stabilizes: DMN → FP → ECN remains functional**

---

## 4. Non-Negotiable Constraints

1. DMN provides templates only; DMN does not generate solutions.
2. FP generates solutions only; FP does not execute actions.
3. ECN executes actions only; ECN does not generate templates or solutions.
4. Hormones modulate network states; they are not phenomenological descriptors.
5. Any explanation that skips the three entry variables is outside AFA-TMA.
