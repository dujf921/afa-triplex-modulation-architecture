# AFA-TMA Example — Relational Dynamics
## A Structural Analysis of a Recurrent Relationship Conflict

This document demonstrates how the AFA Triplex Modulation Architecture (AFA-TMA)
is applied to analyze a recurring relationship conflict.

The analysis strictly follows:
- single-entry constraint
- triplex network separation
- hormone-as-modulation principle

Psychological and emotional language is intentionally excluded.

## 1. Observed Phenomenon (Non-Causal Description)

Two individuals in a long-term relationship repeatedly enter the following pattern:

- discussions escalate rapidly
- attempts at resolution fail to persist
- identical conflicts recur despite prior agreements
- both parties report exhaustion and instability

These observations are treated as **outputs**, not explanations.

---

## 2. Entry Point Selection

According to AFA-TMA rules, the analysis must begin from one entry variable.

**Selected entry point:**  
**DMN template weighting change**

Rationale:
- conflict recurrence indicates stable template dominance
- execution attempts fail after initial engagement
- decision quality is not the primary bottleneck

---

## 3. Network State Analysis

### 3.1 DMN — Template System

- DMN templates are dominated by threat-oriented relational narratives
- templates prioritize predictability, self-protection, and blame attribution
- cortisol-modulated dominance maintains template stability

**Result:**  
DMN.TemplateWeight is locked toward threat-biased templates.

---

### 3.2 FP — Structured Simulation System

- FP receives a constrained template set from DMN
- available solution space is narrow and repetitive
- alternative relational strategies are not simulated with depth

Dopamine insufficiency prevents sustained re-simulation.

**Result:**  
FP.SimulationCapacity is reduced.

---

### 3.3 ECN — Execution Chain System

- ECN receives low-diversity solutions
- execution attempts are short-lived
- agreements collapse under minor perturbations

Oxytocin modulation is insufficient to sustain execution continuity.

**Result:**  
ECN.ExecutionContinuity is unstable.

---

## 4. Hormonal Modulation Mapping

| Hormone   | Primary Effect in This Case |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Cortisol  | Maintains threat-template dominance in DMN |
| Dopamine  | Insufficient to reboot FP simulation |
| Oxytocin  | Insufficient to stabilize execution chains |

Hormones are not interpreted as emotions.
They modulate network states only.

---

## 5. Causal Loop Instantiation

The system instantiates the canonical negative loop:

1. Cortisol dominance → DMN threat templates
2. Threat templates → FP simulation collapse
3. Simulation collapse → ECN execution failure
4. Execution failure → lack of corrective feedback
5. Feedback absence → template reinforcement

The loop self-maintains without external intervention.

---

## 6. Structural Diagnosis (Non-Personal)

The failure mode is attributed to:

- template dominance
- simulation suppression
- execution instability

No attribution is made to:
- personality
- intention
- emotional maturity
- moral responsibility

---

## 7. Minimal Structural Recovery Path (Non-Prescriptive)

AFA-TMA does not prescribe therapy or behavioral instructions.
However, a **structural inversion** can be identified:

- FP simulation must be externally re-enabled
- ECN execution must be externally stabilized
- only after stable feedback can DMN templates update

The recovery condition is structural, not motivational.

---

## 8. Conclusion

This example demonstrates that recurrent relationship conflict can be fully
explained as a **triplex misalignment under hormonal modulation**, without
resorting to emotional or personality-based explanations.

End of example.
